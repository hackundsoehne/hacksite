## About

Hack & SÃ¶hne organizes a pitch workshop in cooperation with Red Bull Basement University (RBBU). Here you will learn to present your ideas to juries, investors or other audiences and not only communicate your concept clearly, but also thrill and inspire your audience.

Towards the end of the event all participants will have the opportunity to hold their own pitch again. The best way to learn pitching is by pitching. If this pitch is for a project under the RBBU motto "Hacking for a better student life", i.e. it actively improves student or campus life, there is also the possibility to have this pitch recorded and thus participate directly at Red Bull Basement University and thereby get a chance to win great prizes. There is also a prize for the best pitch on site.

Of course plenty of food is provided and in the end there will be a cosy get-together with drinks from the barkeeper.
