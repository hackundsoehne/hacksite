With the OpenCodes Hackathon we organized Germanys largest student-run hackathon. It took place in the impressive environment of the Open Codes exhibition at the renowned ZKM art museum and was held under the premise to open the somewhat hidden world of hackathons and coding to the public. Vistors where able to experience the atmosphere of a hackathon and newcomers where encouraged to take part, despite lacking the traditional coding skills. For us it was a huge pleasure to organize the OCH and we are looking forward to provide more unique and special events like this. Have a look at the aftermovie on YouTube as well.
