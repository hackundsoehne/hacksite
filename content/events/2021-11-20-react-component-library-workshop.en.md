Building a web app using a component library can almost feel like **putting together a set of LEGOs**. But how is the component library built?

During this workshop, we share the experience we've gained throughout the development of our own component library ‚Äì the **challenges** to tackle, **decisions** to make, **tools** to use, and the path that's still ahead of us.

Over the course of the day, we will implement a selection of React components according to design specifications from **Figma**, visualize them in **Storybook**, and finally assemble them into a **small web app**.

The workshop will take place from 12-17 o'clock in cooperation with the really great people from [workwise](https://www.workwise.io/) at their headquarters in Karlsruhe and yes, there will be free pizza üòãüçï

Please bring your own laptop, your 2G-proof and your ID card for verification.
