Building a web app using a component library can almost feel like **putting together a set of LEGOs**. But how is the component library built?

During this workshop, we share the experience we've gained throughout the development of our own component library – the **challenges** to tackle, **decisions** to make, **tools** 🔨 to use, and the path that's still ahead of us.

Over the course of the day, we will implement a selection of React components according to design specifications from **Figma** 🎨, visualize them in **Storybook**, and finally assemble them into a **small web app**.

And yes, there will be free pizza 😋🍕

Sounds cool? Nice! 👉 [Click here to register](https://forms.gle/TRiHaJKrv8AeTRLX9)
