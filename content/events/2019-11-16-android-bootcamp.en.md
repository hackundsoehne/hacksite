## About

Together with the developers of JamitLabs we want to present you the basics of App Development with Android. Practice is the best teacher and that's exactly what this workshop is all about. Head of Android Thomas Hofmann teaches you the tools in small theory blocks and in the following practice blocks you get the chance to use them to develop a pre-defined app.

We expect basic knowledge in Java and object-oriented programming. Please bring your own laptop and install Android Studio, an Android emulator, and git before the event. In a few cases we can also provide computers.
