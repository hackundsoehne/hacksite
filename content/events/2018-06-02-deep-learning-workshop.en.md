Doesn't matter whether you are studying economics, civil-, electrical- or mechanical engineering, you probably have heard of the deep learning hype already. We at Hack & Söhne want to unveil what the big buzz-words and names are all about. That is why we are hosting a one-day workshop for you. As a university group we at Hack & Söhne organize techtalks, bootcamps and hackathons to share our passion for technology and the hacking culture with you. We value open mindedness, communication and collaboration across the borders of disciplines. So sign up, come over and get inspired!
