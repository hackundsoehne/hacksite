## Fancy a hackathon?

We're hosting the **hackathon x volume 2** online from June 25 - 27 together with the Badisches Landesmuseum and the Allard Pierson Museum, and everyone is welcome. Come as a team or alone, with or without an idea and win great prizes!

The **prize pool of 9000 EUR** is divided into three categories surrounding the digital museum: **gaming, platforms and artificial intelligence**. Within each category we offer you lots of creative freedom and mentors to support you.

Let your creativity run wild and help shape the museum of the future!

The hackathon will take place online via gather.town to replicate the atmosphere of a physical hackathon as much as possible. **For variety**, there will be fun events, tech talks and yoga sessions in between.

Sounds exciting? Then become a part of this unique experience and sign up now. As always, everything is free of charge and **all participants will receive a survival kit by mail**.
