In this talk, Matthias will present the recently published results of the OpenAI robotics team. They showed that complex and human-like dexterous manipulation can be achieved on a real humanoid hand. They trained their system only on simulated data using large-scale deep reinforcement learning. Still, the system generalizes to the real world, which they achieved through a technique called domain randomization. This talk will not only present their results but will also introduce the fundamental ideas and algorithms behind reinforcement learning as well as domain randomization. A basic understanding of Machine Learning and simple Neural Networks is recommended.
