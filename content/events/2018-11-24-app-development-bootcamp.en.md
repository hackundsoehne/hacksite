## About

Together with the Developers from JamitLabs we want to show you the Basics of iOS App Development with Swift. We all know that we learn best when we actively practice. This is why this workshop is split into small theory blocks followed by hands-on blocks where you can apply what youâ€™ve just learned.
The workshop will be held in german. Food and drinks are provided for free during the entire event.
