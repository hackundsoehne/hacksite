Do new technologies excite you? Why not share that excitement with others? Our goal at Hack & Söhne is to awaken the hacking spirit in people: We want to teach new technologies, inspire with new and unconventional ideas, and challenge people to use their creativity to build something great.

We organize workshops to teach people about new and interesting technologies. Make no mistake - our workshops are not held in the stereotypical lecture format. We combine presentation sections with practical hands-on sections to ensure our participants actually learn something. If you're good at something and you want to share your knowledge, or if you simply need an opportunity to learn something new, why not host a workshop?

We organize tech talks to share interesting ideas and incentives. Whether the topic is a new version of Java or a machine learning algorithm to teach robots to solve rubik's cubes - it's all about exciting ideas presented by interesting speakers. If you know somebody who's working on something cool and you've always wanted to learn more about their work, why not invite them to give a tech talk?

Our core business is organizing hackathons. A hackathon is an event where we challenge lots of participants to build something cool over the course of a weekend. This usually involves lots of energy drinks and little sleep - but it's always extremely fun and a great opportunity to learn something new and meet like-minded people. Anyone who has participated in a hackathon before can understand why we're so excited about organizing them!

Here are some reasons why joining us is a great idea:

- **It's fun! Seriously**. You get to make new friends and do something that actively benefits the people who participate in our events.

- **It's a great way to learn about new technologies**. Before we design workshops or tech talks, we need to do research on the topics. This is a great way for us to learn new things. If you've always been looking for a chance to learn Rust, why not do it now with the goal of hosting a Rust workshop? That way you will not only be more motivated, but you will also develop a deeper understanding of what you're trying to learn (teaching is ironically always the best way to learn).

- **Networking.** Organizing events involves forming connections with people - the sponsors, the jury, the speakers, the participants. This is a great way to increase your network, and the author of this page speaks from experience when he says that these connections have opened up some new opportunities for him in the past.

- **It's a great way to improve your soft skills**. Time management, teamwork, project management and networking are all a natural part of what we do. But there will also be plenty of opportunities to improve your speaking skills - you could even host your own workshop. Keep in mind these are only opportunities - we don't force anyone to do anything they don't want to do.
Last but not least, it's a great addition to your CV.

Still not convinced? Maybe some cool videos will change that:
