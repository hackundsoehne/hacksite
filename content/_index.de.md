### Who we are?

We're a German student-run nonprofit organisation focused all around coding and hacking. We try to bring a bit of silicon valley to the german computer-science and start-up community by disrupting the status quo. We do this by organising hackathons, coding boot camps and other similar events.

Our team consists of students from a variety of backgrounds: Computer Science, Electrical Engineering and Information Technologies, Economics, Business and more.

We organize Hackathons, Bootcamps and Tech Talks to bring people together, give them a chance to meet new companies, and of course show them a ton of new stuff. From time to time we organize hackathons to find out who is the best hacker in town.
